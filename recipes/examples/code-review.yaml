steps:
  - id: "analyze"
    name: "Analyze code structure"
    tool: "ollama"
    action: "generate"
    inputs:
      model: "{{inputs.model}}"
      system: "You are a code reviewer. Analyze code structure concisely."
      prompt: |
        Analyze this {{inputs.language}} code file at {{inputs.file_path}}.
        List: number of functions, classes, imports, and overall structure.
        Be brief — bullet points only.

  - id: "review"
    name: "Perform detailed review"
    tool: "ollama"
    action: "generate"
    inputs:
      model: "{{inputs.model}}"
      system: "You are a senior code reviewer. Be specific and actionable."
      prompt: |
        Review this code. Focus on: {{inputs.focus}}

        Code structure:
        {{steps.analyze.outputs.response}}

        For each issue found, provide:
        1. Severity (critical/warning/info)
        2. Location (function or line description)
        3. Problem description
        4. Suggested fix

  - id: "summarize"
    name: "Generate review summary"
    tool: "ollama"
    action: "generate"
    inputs:
      model: "{{inputs.model}}"
      system: "Summarize code reviews into an executive summary."
      prompt: |
        Summarize this code review into 3-5 bullet points:
        {{steps.review.outputs.response}}

        Start with overall assessment (pass/needs-work/critical-issues).

  - id: "save_output"
    name: "Create output directory"
    tool: "file_ops"
